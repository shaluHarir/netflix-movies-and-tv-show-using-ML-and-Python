This project utilized the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to develop a prediction model for user preferences. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we were able to enhance content recommendation and improve the user experience on Netflix. The insights gained from this analysis provide a foundation for future enhancements and optimizations
### Dataset Overview
The Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset consists of a vast collection of movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform. The dataset includes information such as title, director, cast, genre, country, release year, duration, and rating. This dataset provides the foundation for understanding user preferences and content popularity.
### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Statistical analysis and visualizations were used to identify trends and patterns in user preferences and content popularity. This process provided valuable insights to guide the subsequent modeling steps.
### Predictive Modeling

A variety of machine learning algorithms were explored for predicting user preferences. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models. Multiple evaluation metrics were used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
